        <p class="p2">The office building is a very tangible reflection of a profound change in employment patterns that occurred over the last one hundred years.
             In the U.S., northern Europe, and Japan, at least 50 percent of the working population is employed in office settings as compared to
              5 percent of the population at the beginning of the 20th century. However, today's office buildings are experiencing even more change
               due to the recent pandemic. The office is now a place for collaboration, talent recruitment, onboarding, and inspiration with new requirements
                and expectations that combine physical spaces with technologically supported ways to work, in the office or remotely.</p><br>

        <img  class="comm" src="youth png.jpg" alt="community image">
        <p class="p6">A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as place, norms, religion, values, customs, or identity.
             Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms.
              Durable good relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family,
               home, work, government, society, or humanity at large.</p>
