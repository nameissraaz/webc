             The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικὸς κύκλος (galaktikòs kýklos),
              meaning "milky circle".[26][27] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed 
              from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until 
              the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[28]
               Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[29] observations by 
               Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.The Milky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes

        <p class="w4">The following thoughts are a brief summary of my PhD. The PhD was written in the 1990s but its central theme — 
            the use and misuse of the term “community” in politics — seems not to have gone away. So, for what it’s worth, here are my
             thoughts on what “community” means and why it’s an important concept for people interested in social change…

            The word “community” has a strange power to it. It conveys a sense of togetherness and positivity. 
            It speaks both of solidarity and homeliness. For example, attach the word “community” to “policing” and
             it turns the legitimate monopoly power of the state over the use of force into something warm and cuddly.</p>

        <p class="w5">“I hate networking.” We hear this all the time from executives, other professionals, and MBA students.
             They tell us that networking makes them feel uncomfortable and phony—even dirty. Although some people have a natural
              passion for it—namely, the extroverts who love and thrive on social interaction—many understandably see
               it as brown-nosing, exploitative, and inauthentic.
